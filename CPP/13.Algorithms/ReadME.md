# Algorithms And Data Structure
Is a way to contain and organize the data to be processed by an algorithm for solving a problem.
_Algorithms is the logic and control that solves a problem_


## 1.Algorithms:
- Greedy
- Divide and conquer
- Dyanmic programming
- Exhaustive search
  
## 2.Data Structure:
1) ### _linear:-_
- Arrays ---> Sequential
- Linked lists ---> non Sequential using pointer.
- Stack ---> (FILO) first in last out.
- Queue ---> (FIFO) first in first out.


2) ### _Non-linear:-_
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables


### Binary Search:
- Need to be sort and sequentially.
- Divide and conquer approach.
- No enhanced performance for very small lists.

### Binary Sort:
1. Selection Sort O(N^2)
2. Bubble Sort O(N^2)
3. Merge Sort O(log2N)
